This project was my first experience with Python programming, offering a fun and interactive way to get started with coding. 
The game allows two players to take turns and compete on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features
Two-player mode
Text-based interface
Input validation
Easy-to-understand code for beginners

## How to Play
Run the script.
Players take turns entering their move by specifying the row and column numbers.
The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
The game ends when there is a winner or the grid is full.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the game script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python3 Tic_Tac_Toe.py
